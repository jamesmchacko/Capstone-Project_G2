# Capstone-Project_G2
# Health Monitoring Device using IoT Based Headphone

This Repository is maintained for the Capstone Project to be carried out as part of requirements towards the course completion for the Embedded System Engineering Design Course. The duration of the project would for 4 months starting from January 20201 - August 19, 2021.

The contributors for this repository would be James Chacko,Fahad Rahman,Premil Pressanan and Christy Rachel Philip

This Capstone Project would be guided under the supervision of Dr. Mike Aleshams, Professor

This Repository will be having folders relating to the Capstone Project which would be as follows:

Presentation & Reports: All Presentation files for demonstrating the project as well showcasing the project timeline along with final report for the project shall be present here.

Project Proposal: Series of the proposal were made before the final approval was given by the guide. One can find all version of proposal in this folder

Codes: All the programming required for the Capstone shall be present here

Hardware: Any Special Hardware related document or file would be present here.

Schematic Capture and PCB Design: Schematics required for the project shall be uploaded in this folder and also the PCB design for the intended project

# Description of our Project

Humans now are more cautious about their health. People nowadays go to hospitals for a full-body check-up regularly. For instance, there have been many incidents of accidents in Canada because of a lack of health monitoring. These incidents lead to the development of specific portable health monitoring devices that people can use daily.Here we are introducing our product as a solution. This health monitoring device consists of temperature sensors, a body surface electrode, and an SPO2 sensor directly connected to the users' bodies. All the signals from these peripheral devices are transferring to the microcontroller. With the help of IoT, data is transmitted to the user's smartphone, and all the health data can be analyzed within the phone using a customized application.Moreover, if the user feels an emergency health failure, an additional switch is added in the design to call 911 by pressing this switch directly. We can also add a facility to automatically identify a patient's emergency condition by itself and call an emergency automatically. In addition to this, since we are adding a GPS module to this, we can access the patient’s location.

# Features of Our project


Through this project we demonstrate the use of commnication protocols such as the IEEE 802.11 (WiFi), Serial GPIOs, Serial UART,I2C and SPI also using the Cloud service called as ESP32 webserver and the transfer the data to the cloud via the MQTT
